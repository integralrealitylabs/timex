### Steps to reproduce

- API function called
- Arguments provided

### Description of issue

- What are the expected results?
- If you are certain this is a bug in Timex, do you have references I
  can use to check the algorithm/logic against? For instance, a well-established
  date/time library in another language, a paper, test suite, etc. It is by no
  means a requirement, but is immensely helpful in fixing bugs, and provides me
  extra data to use when building out the test suite
